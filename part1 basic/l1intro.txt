=> Typescript

Typescript is a programming language develop from Microsoft
we ca gain advantage
    (i) Type safety
    (ii) Error Detection

i. Early Error Detection
    Typescript catches errors at compile time. This help prevent runtime errors and make your code more reliable

ii. Improved Readability & Maintainability
        Easier to read and understand. Other developers can quickly understand as well

Javascript small-scale applications
Typescript medium-large applications

Typescript can use for Client-Side as Reactjs & Angularjs
Typescript can use for Server-Side as Nodejs & Deno


Typescript VS JavaScript

= TypeScript
    (i) Static Programming Language
    (ii) Complied ( TypeScript compiler = tsc )
    (iii) Compilation Errors

= JavaScript
    (i) Dynamic Programming Language
    (ii) Interpreted
    (iii) Runtime Errors
